### Summary

The University of Zurich together with the University Hospital of Zurich are embarking on a concerted effort to develop informatics programs to advance biomedical research and healthcare using cutting edge computational approaches. As part of these efforts, the Chair of Medical Informatics (https://krauthammerlab.ch) investigates topics in clinical data science and translational bioinformatics, such as knowledge discovery from Big Data sources (Electronic Medical Records, health registries) as well as the analysis of human Omics data. 

We are currently looking for a motivated NLP Research Engineer (Medicine). The position is jointly funded by the Comprehensive Cancer Center Zurich (https://www.usz.ch/en/clinic/comprehensive-cancer-center-zuerich/) and is focused on the extraction of structured information from text, as well as medical text generation. The position is part of a strategic effort to foster the digitalization of the cancer center, which aims at making better use of routinely collected data for research and clinical practice.  

The candidate will be involved in other ongoing lab activities (particularly the supervision of junior lab members and some teaching activities). We offer an interdisciplinary research environment, the possibility to direct your own research, access to state-of-the-art computational resources infrastructure (further details are listed below) and a formidable place to grow academically
