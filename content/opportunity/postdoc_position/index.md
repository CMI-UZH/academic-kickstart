### Summary

The University of Zurich together with the University Hospital of Zurich are embarking on a concerted effort to develop informatics programs to advance biomedical research and healthcare using cutting edge computational approaches. As part of these efforts, the Chair of Medical Informatics (https://krauthammerlab.ch) investigates topics in clinical data science and translational bioinformatics, such as knowledge discovery from Big Data sources (Electronic Medical Records, health registries) as well as the analysis of human Omics data. 
We are currently looking for a motivated PostDoc in Health AI who will work at the intersection of computation, biology and medicine. Particularly, the candidate will support our ongoing work in applying AI to the space of genetic engineering, including the prediction of base editor outcomes, the optimization of base editors and the optimal use of base editors in complex genetic diseases. This work is part of the University Research Priority Program (URPP) «Human Reproduction Reloaded» (see https://www.humanreproduction.uzh.ch/en/Research-Areas/CRISPR-Technology-in-Human-Reproduction.html). 
The PostDoc will be involved in other ongoing lab activities (particularly the supervision of junior lab members and some teaching activities) and will be integral part of the URPP research community. We offer an interdisciplinary research environment, the possibility to direct your own research, access to state-of-the-art computational resources infrastructure (further details are listed below) and a formidable place to grow academically. 

### Qualifications

• The project's aim is to characterize the effects of transcriptional and epigenetic processes on mutational patterns in cancer.
• PhD degree in computer science (focused on machine learning), optimization, statistics, applied math, computational biology or closely related discipline.
• Strong publication record with at least one first-author paper in top-tier conferences (such as NeurIPS, ICML, ACL, CVPR, AISTATS, AAAI, ICLR, etc.)
• Proficient in Python and the scientific computing stack (SciPy, Numpy, Scikit- learn, pandas)
• Proficient in one of the deep learning frameworks (PyTorch, Tensorflow)
• Prior health- and biology- related computational work is a plus
