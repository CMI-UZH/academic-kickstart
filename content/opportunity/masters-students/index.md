We are currently looking for Master's students in the field of bioinformatics for the following topics

### Data integration in Cancer Genomics

The project's aim is to characterize the effects of transcriptional and epigenetic processes on mutational patterns in cancer.
The student should have basic experience with Unix systems and some experience with at least one scripting language (e.g. Python, R or bash). Prior experience with genomics software (mappers, samtools or variant callers) is an advantage.

### Mapping structural variation in cancer

Genome sequencing data are going to be used in order to discover novel structural variants in various cancer types (melanoma,   colorectal carcinoma, lung cancer, etc.). The clinical significance of the novel and already known structural variants will also be evaluated using genome annotations.
The student should have basic experience with Unix systems and some experience with at least one scripting language (e.g. Python). Prior experience with genomics software (mappers, samtools or variant callers) is an advantage. 

### Analyzing cell-free DNA fragmentation patterns in clinical samples

This project aims to improve diagnosis and prognosis through liquid biopsies in cancer and various other diseases. 
The student should have basic experience with Unix systems, some experience with at least one scripting language (e.g. Python) and a basic understanding of machine learning algorithms.

### Information extraction from German Radiology Report

Large, labeled datasets have driven deep learning methods to achieve expert-level performance on a variety of medical imaging tasks. There are some English radiology report datasets that have been labeled automatically to detect in presence of 14 observations by capturing uncertainties inherent in radiograph interpretation.
We would like to investigate different approaches such as the information extraction paradigm to label radiology reports in another language such as German. We plan to explore the possibility of incorporating domain knowledge such as http://radlex.org/ and evaluate the effectiveness of it in the proposed framework.
Since a radiology report comes with radiology images, we also would like to investigate the multi-modal approaches in our study.

Applications can be done by sending a CV to this <a href="#" onclick="u='michael.krauthammer'; d='uzh.ch'; prompt('Copy address to clipboard',u+'@'+d); return false">e-mail</a> along with a short description of the student's motivation to join our lab.
