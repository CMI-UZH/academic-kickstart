The Krauthammer lab (at the University of Zurich) and the Wicki Lab (at the University Hospital of Zurich) are seeking a motivated PhD candidate to work on AI-driven research at the intersection of precision oncology and data science, with a particular focus on leveraging multi-modal clinical data to support personalized cancer treatment decisions.

### Your Responsibilities

The primary goal of this position is to develop state-of-the-art machine learning approaches to enhance personalised decision-making in oncology care in the following aspects:


- Developing predictive models to forecast treatment outcomes and side effects based on retrospective observational clinical data.
- Implementing counterfactual inference and causal machine learning methods to identify optimal treatments and evaluate treatment biases.
- Incorporating explainable AI tools (e.g., SHAP values) and uncertainty quantification techniques (e.g., conformal prediction) to enhance the interpretability and reliability of predictions.
- Collaborating closely with oncologists and data scientists to align AI tools with clinical workflows and real-world needs.   

You also have the possibilities to expand the research scope to other innovative projects in AI for healthcare and clinical data science.

### Your Profile

Minimum qualifications:
- Masterâ€™s degree (MSc) in computer science, machine learning, statistics, applied mathematics, or a related discipline.
- Proficiency in Python and core scientific computing libraries (e.g., NumPy, SciPy, Scikit-learn, pandas).
- Experience with at least one deep learning framework (e.g., PyTorch, TensorFlow, or JAX).
- Strong foundational knowledge of machine learning and predictive modeling techniques.

Preferred qualifications:
- Knowledge of longitudinal data analysis, time-series modeling, or causal inference methods.
- Experience with explainable AI techniques for model interpretability.
- Familiarity with multi-modal data integration (e.g., clinical, genetic, proteomics).
- Proficiency in Linux systems, Docker, and high-performance computing (HPC) environments.

### What We Offer
- Access to state-of-the-art computational resources, clinical datasets, and expert medical collaborators.
- An opportunity to work on cutting-edge AI projects with real-world impact in healthcare.
- A stimulating, interdisciplinary research environment within the University of Zurich and the University Hospital of Zurich.
- Competitive salary and support for attending conferences and publishing in top-tier journals.
- Outstanding working conditions in the vibrant city of Zurich, Switzerland.

### Place of Work
Zurich, Switzerland

### Start of Employment
Employment start date is flexible and will be mutually agreed upon.
