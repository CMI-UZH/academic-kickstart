## Summary

The University of Zurich together with the University Hospital of Zurich are embarking on a
concerted effort to develop informatics programs to advance biomedical research and
healthcare using cutting edge computational approaches. As part of these efforts, the newly
created Chair of Medical Informatics will establish a research group that will investigate
topics in clinical data science and translational bioinformatics, such as knowledge discovery
from Big Data sources (Electronic Medical Record), development of Natural Language
processing, information retrieval and extraction routines, as well as the analysis of human
Omics data. One key goal is the building of predictive algorithms for guiding patient therapy
across all disease stages. The group is headed by Prof. Michael Krauthammer who is joining
the University of Zurich after having led a research group in biomedical informatics at Yale
University. For this position, we are looking for motivated PostDoc candidate who is
interested in applying his computational skills to real world medical problems. We offer an
interdisciplinary research environment, the possibility to direct your own research and access
to state-of-the-art computational resources infrastructure (further details are listed below).

## Qualifications

- PhD degree in computer science (focused on machine learning), optimization,
statistics, applied math or closely related discipline.
- Strong publication record with at least one first-author paper in top-tier
conferences (such as NeurIPS, ICML, ACL, CVPR, AISTATS, AAAI, ICLR,
etc.)
- Proficient in Python and the scientific computing stack (SciPy, Numpy, Scikit-
learn)
- Proficient in one of the deep learning frameworks (PyTorch, Tensorflow)

## What we offer

- Access to state-of-the-art infrastructure (computational resources), clinical
datasets and medical expertise domain-knowledge (excellent medical doctors
and research scientists)
- Ability to make a real and tangible impact in healthcare research
- Solve real-world problems and improve hospital-related processes and
workflow
- Stimulating research environment and a place to grow academically and
professionally
- Outstanding working conditions at the University of Zurich (more details [here](
http://www.pa.uzh.ch/en/Willkommen-an-der-UZH.html)).

## Application

Applicants should submit the following documents (preferably in a single PDF) to
michael.krauthammer@uzh.ch with subject heading “Postdoc (Machine Learning in
Healthcare)”:
- CV with list of publications
- Statement of research interests with a letter of motivation (2-3 pages max, in English)
- Name, address and email contact of three referees (for letters of recommendation)
