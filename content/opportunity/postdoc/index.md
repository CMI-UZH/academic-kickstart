Digital Health Zurich (DHZ) is a new research initiative between the University of Zurich (UZH), Zurich University of Applied Sciences (ZHAW) and praxis partners (hospitals, pharma and others). The goal of the project is to investigate digital health solutions in the hospital context and implement them efficiently and with practical relevance. Core topics are Patient Reported Outcome Measure (PROMs), remote monitoring, integrated care and related technologies as well as empowerment of patients and staff. Our vision is to establish a sustainable, data-driven and cross-institutional digital ecosystem by connecting patients, health professionals, technology and research in Zurich and beyond. To accomplish this, we focus on translating research and developing sustainable real-world digital health solutions, taking the needs of patients and health providers into account, pursuing a participatory approach, supporting efficient and cross-institutional collaboration and promoting digital innovation in the Zurich healthcare system and beyond.
