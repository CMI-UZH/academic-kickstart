    We are looking for a Machine Learning NLP Engineer with a passion for working on medical problems that can help us create NLP tools in the medical field.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            You will be someone who loves to code and build working systems. You are used to working in a research environment. You will have experience with the software development life cycle, from ideation through implementation to testing and release. You will also have extensive knowledge and experience in the NLP domain.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            You will join a group of 3-4 NLP researchers in the Krauthammer Lab and will have the opportunity to collaborate with multiple research teams at the Hospital University of Zurich and the University of Zurich. In this position, you&#39;ll be working at the heart of our NLP Team, helping us work on the automatic generation of medical reports from medical images and as well as helping to convert unstructured medical text to structured information.
