### Summary

Time series analysis plays an important role in various industries such as medical informatics, healthcare, financial market, and climate modeling. Recent development in machine learning has promised to revolutionize predicting and classifying time sequences, by means of temporal convolutional networks and transformers. Although many state-of-the-art models have reached good performance in time series forecasting and classification, many time series tasks remain a challenge. Our research interest lies in time series representation learning, which aims to capture both contextual and temporal information at any resolution and generate representations to improve multiple downstream tasks (patient sequence similarity, etc.).

Inspired by recent contrastive representation learning in the field of computer vision, we hope to improve the performance of SOTA time series models by designing adaptive contrastive methods.
