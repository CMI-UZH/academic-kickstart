 abstract = {Prime editing is a versatile genome editing tool but requires experimental optimization of the prime editing guide RNA (pegRNA) to achieve high editing efficiency. This study used a high-throughput screen to analyze 92,423 pegRNAs and identified sequence context features influencing prime editing. The authors developed PRIDICT, a machine learning model that predicts editing efficiency with high accuracy across diverse genetic edits. PRIDICT was validated in different cell lines and in vivo, showing its utility in both basic and translational research.},
