abstract: "This study introduces machine learning models that predict prime editing efficiency across various chromatin contexts. PRIDICT2.0 evaluates pegRNA performance for a wide range of edits, while ePRIDICT assesses the influence of chromatin environments on editing rates. These tools are designed to optimize prime editing strategies across different cellular conditions, enhancing genome editing precision."
