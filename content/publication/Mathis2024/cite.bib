 abstract = {The success of prime editing depends on the prime editing guide RNA (pegRNA) design and target locus. In this study, machine learning models were developed to reliably predict prime editing efficiency across diverse chromatin contexts. PRIDICT2.0 evaluates pegRNA performance for edits up to 15 bp in length in both mismatch repair-deficient and proficient cell lines, while ePRIDICT quantifies the impact of chromatin environments on editing rates. These models offer a powerful tool for optimizing prime editing strategies in different cellular contexts.},
