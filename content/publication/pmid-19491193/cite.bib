 abstract = {DNA methylation is an important component of epigenetic modifications$\backslash$nthat influences the transcriptional machinery and aberrant in many$\backslash$nhuman diseases. In this study we present the first genome-wide integrative$\backslash$nanalysis of promoter methylation and gene expression for the identification$\backslash$nof methylation markers in melanoma. Genome-wide promoter methylation$\backslash$nand gene expression of eight early-passage human melanoma cell strains$\backslash$nwere compared to newborn and adult melanocytes. We used linear mixed$\backslash$neffect models (LME) in combination with a series of filters based$\backslash$non the localization of promoter methylation relative to the transcription$\backslash$nstart site, overall promoter CpG content, and differential gene expression$\backslash$nto discover DNA methylation markers. This approach identified 76$\backslash$nmarkers, of which 68 were hyper- and 8 hypo-methylated (LME P \textless 0.05).$\backslash$nPromoter methylation and differential gene expression of five markers$\backslash$n(COL1A2, NPM2, HSPB6, DDIT4L, MT1G) were validated by sequencing$\backslash$nof bisulfite modified DNA and real-time reverse transcriptase PCR,$\backslash$nrespectively. Importantly, the incidence of promoter methylation$\backslash$nof the validated markers increased moderately in early- and significantly$\backslash$nin advanced-stage melanomas, employing early-passage cell strains$\backslash$nand snap frozen tissues (n = 18 and n = 24, respectively) compared$\backslash$nto normal melanocytes and nevi (n = 11 and n = 9, respectively).$\backslash$nOur approach allows robust identification of methylation markers$\backslash$nthat can be applied to other studies involving genome-wide promoter$\backslash$nmethylation. In conclusion, this study represents the first unbiased$\backslash$nsystematic effort to determine methylation markers in melanoma, and$\backslash$nrevealed several novel genes regulated by promoter methylation that$\backslash$nwere not described in cancer cells before.},
