 abstract = {This study demonstrates that surplus human tumor tissues slow-frozen immediately after resection can be used effectively for a variety of research applications, including 2D, 3D, and ex vivo cultures, as well as single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq). The study compares these methods to fresh tissues, showing similar results and validating the use of slow-frozen tissues for translational research and biobanking.},
