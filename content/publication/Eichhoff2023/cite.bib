 abstract = {Clinical management of NRAS-mutated melanomas is challenging due to resistance mechanisms. This study identifies a metabolic vulnerability in NRAS-mutated melanoma cells that could be targeted using a combination of a ROS inducer and a MEK inhibitor. Through multiomics analyses and in vivo experiments, the study shows that drug-resistant melanoma cells exhibit elevated ROS levels and are highly sensitive to ROS induction, suggesting potential therapeutic strategies to overcome resistance.},
