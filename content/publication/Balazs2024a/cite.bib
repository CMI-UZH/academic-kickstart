 abstract = {Method development for the analysis of cell-free DNA (cfDNA) sequencing data is impeded by limited data sharing due to the strict control of sensitive genomic data. Fragmentstein, a command-line tool, addresses this issue by converting non-sensitive cfDNA fragmentation data into alignment mapping (BAM) files. This tool complements fragment coordinates with sequence information from a reference genome to reconstruct BAM files, enabling analyses such as copy number variant (CNV), nucleosome occupancy, and fragment length from non-sensitive data.},
