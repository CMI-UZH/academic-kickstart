 abstract = {Background: Basal cell carcinoma (BCC) is the most frequently diagnosed skin cancer and the most common malignancy in humans. Different morphological subtypes of BCC are associated with a low or high risk of recurrence and aggressiveness. This study characterizes the stroma of different BCC subtypes, focusing on cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) and their expression of COL10A1. Methods: Using laser capture microdissection followed by RNA sequencing, distinct gene expression signatures were identified in the stroma of various BCC subtypes. Results: COL10A1 was found to be overexpressed in high-risk BCC subtypes, particularly in sclerosing/infiltrative and basosquamous subtypes. Immunohistochemistry confirmed the presence of COL10A1 in the stroma, correlating with aggressive behavior. Conclusion: COL10A1 may serve as a prognostic biomarker for BCC progression and a target for personalized treatment.},
