abstract: "This study characterizes the stroma of different basal cell carcinoma (BCC) subtypes, focusing on cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) and their expression of COL10A1. Using laser capture microdissection followed by RNA sequencing, distinct gene expression signatures were identified. COL10A1 was found to be overexpressed in high-risk BCC subtypes, particularly in sclerosing/infiltrative and basosquamous subtypes. Immunohistochemistry confirmed the presence of COL10A1 in the stroma, correlating with aggressive behavior, making it a potential prognostic biomarker for BCC progression."

summary: "We identified COL10A1 as a marker of high-risk BCC subtypes, particularly in sclerosing/infiltrative and basosquamous subtypes. This could serve as a prognostic biomarker and a target for personalized treatment."
