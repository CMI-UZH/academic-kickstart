 abstract = {Talimogene laherparepvec (T-VEC) is a genetically modified herpes simplex virus approved for cancer therapy. This study investigates its effects at the clinical, histological, single-cell transcriptomic, and immune repertoire levels using repeated fine-needle aspirates (FNAs) of both injected and noninjected lesions in primary cutaneous B-cell lymphoma (pCBCL). The results demonstrate that T-VEC mediates rapid eradication of malignant cells and significant remodeling of the tumor microenvironment, with increased NK cells, monocytes, and cytotoxic T-cells, alongside a reduction in regulatory T-cells.},
