 abstract = {Health-care institutions are gaining an increasing interest in exploiting the data that are gathered through electronic medical records. Narrative data, generated by transcription or direct entry, represents a far greater challenge for analytic tasks. Moreover, a small number of institutions are beginning to explore deeper structuring of narrative data using natural language processing (NLP). The data produced by NLP systems has a complex, nested structure. Current electronic medical records do not have the ability to store and retrieve data of this complexity in a suitable way.},
