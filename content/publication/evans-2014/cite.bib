 abstract = {Exome sequencing in cancer is a powerful tool for identifying mutational events across the coding region of human genes. Here, we describe computational methods that use exome sequencing reads from cancer samples to identify somatic single nucleotide variants (SNVs), copy number alterations, and short insertions and deletions (InDels). We further describe analytical methods to generate lists of driver genes with more mutational events than expected by chance.},
