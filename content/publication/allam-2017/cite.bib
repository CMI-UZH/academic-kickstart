 abstract = {Motivation: Text and genomic data are composed of sequential tokens,
such as words and nucleotides that give rise to higher order syntactic
constructs. In this work, we aim at providing a comprehensive Python
library implementing conditional random fields (CRFs), a class of
probabilistic graphical models, for robust prediction of these
constructs from sequential data.
Results: Python Sequence Labeling (PySeqLab) is an open source package
for performing supervised learning in structured prediction tasks. It
implements CRFs models, that is discriminative models from (i)
first-order to higher-order linear-chain CRFs, and from (ii) first-order
to higher-order semi-Markov CRFs (semi-CRFs). Moreover, it provides
multiple learning algorithms for estimating model parameters such as (i)
stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and its multiple variations, (ii)
structured perceptron with multiple averaging schemes supporting exact
and inexact search using `violation-fixing' framework, (iii)
search-based probabilistic online learning algorithm (SAPO) and (iv) an
interface for Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno (BFGS) and the
limited-memory BFGS algorithms. Viterbi and Viterbi A\*\ are used for
inference and decoding of sequences. Using PySeqLab, we built models
(classifiers) and evaluated their performance in three different
domains: (i) biomedical Natural language processing (NLP), (ii)
predictive DNA sequence analysis and (iii) Human activity recognition
(HAR). State-of-the-art performance comparable to machine-learning based
systems was achieved in the three domains without feature engineering or
the use of knowledge sources.
