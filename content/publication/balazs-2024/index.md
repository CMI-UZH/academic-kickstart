**Background and Purpose**
Current radiotherapy guidelines rely heavily on imaging-based monitoring. Liquid biopsy monitoring promises to complement imaging by providing frequent systemic information about the tumor. In particular, cell-free DNA (cfDNA) sequencing offers a tumor-agnostic approach, which lends itself to monitoring heterogeneous cohorts of cancer patients.
**Methods**
We collected plasma cfDNA from oligometastatic patients (OMD) and head-and-neck cancer patients (SCCHN) at six time points before, during, and after radiotherapy, and compared them to the plasma samples of healthy and polymetastatic volunteers. We performed low-pass (on average 7x) whole-genome sequencing on 93 plasma cfDNA samples and correlated copy number alterations and fragment length distributions to clinical and imaging findings.
**Results**
We observed copy number alterations in 4/7 polymetastatic cancer patients, 1/7 OMD and 1/7 SCCHN patients, these patientsâ€™ imaging showed progression following radiotherapy. Using unsupervised learning, we identified cancer-specific fragment length features that showed a strong correlation with copy number-based tumor fraction estimates. In 4/4 HPV-positive SCCHN patient samples, we detected viral DNA that enabled the monitoring of very low tumor fraction samples.
**Conclusions**
Our results indicate that an elevated tumor fraction is associated with tumor aggressiveness and systemic tumor spread. This information may be used to adapt treatment strategies. Further, we show that by detecting specific sequences such as viral DNA, the sensitivity of detecting cancer from cell-free DNA sequencing data can be greatly increased.
