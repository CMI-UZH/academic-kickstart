abstract: "Current radiotherapy guidelines rely heavily on imaging-based monitoring. Liquid biopsy monitoring, particularly cell-free DNA (cfDNA) sequencing, offers a tumor-agnostic approach to complement imaging by providing frequent systemic information about the tumor. This study collected plasma cfDNA from oligometastatic and head-and-neck cancer patients at multiple time points before, during, and after radiotherapy, and compared these to healthy and polymetastatic volunteers. Low-pass whole-genome sequencing revealed correlations between copy number alterations, fragment length distributions, and clinical outcomes, suggesting that cfDNA sequencing can enhance monitoring and inform treatment adaptation."
