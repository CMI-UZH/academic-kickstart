 abstract = {Background and Purpose: Current radiotherapy guidelines rely heavily on imaging-based monitoring. Liquid biopsy monitoring promises to complement imaging by providing frequent systemic information about the tumor. In particular, cell-free DNA (cfDNA) sequencing offers a tumor-agnostic approach, which lends itself to monitoring heterogeneous cohorts of cancer patients. Methods: Plasma cfDNA was collected from oligometastatic patients (OMD) and head-and-neck cancer patients (SCCHN) at six time points before, during, and after radiotherapy, and compared to plasma samples from healthy and polymetastatic volunteers. Low-pass whole-genome sequencing on 93 plasma cfDNA samples was performed, correlating copy number alterations and fragment length distributions to clinical and imaging findings. Results: The study observed copy number alterations and cancer-specific fragment length features correlating with tumor fraction estimates. Viral DNA detection enhanced sensitivity in HPV-positive SCCHN patients. Conclusions: Elevated tumor fraction is associated with tumor aggressiveness and systemic spread, suggesting potential adaptation of treatment strategies.},
