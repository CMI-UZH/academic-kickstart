 abstract = {PDE4B (phosphodiesterase-4B) plays a crucial role in cancer and pharmacology, particularly in Native Americans where variants are linked to acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) relapse. This study examines the genetic diversity of PDE4B in 951 individuals from Native American populations, revealing high frequencies of ALL relapse-associated alleles, which may influence the need for ancestry-adjusted chemotherapy in these populations.},
