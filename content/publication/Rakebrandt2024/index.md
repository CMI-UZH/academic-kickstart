abstract: "This study identifies a subset of memory T helper 1 (Th1) cells that influence subsequent immune responses regardless of specificity. These innate acting memory Th1 cells are recruited to inflammation sites, rapidly producing cytokines that modulate disease susceptibility. While they offer protection during infections, they can also accelerate autoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis."

summary: "We identify memory Th1 cells that act as innate cells, impacting the immune response to unrelated diseases and potentially accelerating autoimmune conditions."
