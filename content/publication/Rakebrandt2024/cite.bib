 abstract = {Through immune memory, infections leave lasting imprints on the host immune system. This study identifies a subset of memory T helper 1 (Th1) cells that can influence subsequent immune responses irrespective of their specificity. These innate acting memory Th1 cells are characterized by their recruitment to sites of inflammation and rapid cytokine production, modulating disease susceptibility in various contexts. This study highlights the dual role of these cells in providing protection during infections while potentially accelerating autoimmune conditions like multiple sclerosis.},
