I'm in my last semester of Bachelor in Biotechnology at ZHAW, writing my bachelor thesis on "Identification of SVs with long-read sequencing". Before my studies I worked at FGen GmbH, optimising the expression of proteins. During my studies, I developed further interest in molecular biology and bioinformatics. In summer I will start my MSc in Applied Computational Life Sciences at ZHAW in Wädenswil.
Other interests of mine are: hiking, playing basketball, riding a motorcycle and knitting.
