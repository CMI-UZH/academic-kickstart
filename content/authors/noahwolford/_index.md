I am fascinated by both the strict regulation and complexity of biological systems.
In particular, I am interested in new sources of biological data and techniques in machine learning which allow us to cut through this complexity and produce useful results in medicine and biotechnology.
At the Krauthammer lab, I am working on my master's thesis on the topic of developing an autoencoder for downsampling cfDNA sequencing coverage for prediction of nucleosome occupancy.
During my free time, I enjoy playing music and cooking.
