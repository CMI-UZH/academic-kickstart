Laura likes to think about not just what can you do with Data Science, but _how_ do you do it?
How can good software tools make our models more quickly iterated upon, our data pipelines more reproducible, and our code easier to collaborate on?
Previously, she worked as a Data Scientist at a healthcare IT company. 
Other interests include ecology, hiking, and the SBB train network.
