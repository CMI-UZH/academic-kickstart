I did mathemtaics and applied mathematics for my bachelor and master, then I did my PhD in fundemental machine learning research at the University of Geneva. My main focus of research was incorporating domain knowleadge into deep learning models with the form of reguarizer, enabling conditional generation of discrete sturctured data such as molecules. Currently I am interested in applying machine learning models on helath care such as genetic enginering and drug design.
