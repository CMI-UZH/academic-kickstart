I use bioinformatics in Oncogenomics. During my PhD, I worked with virus transcriptomics (mainly herpesviruses) with a focus of implementing methods for the analysis of long-read RNA-Seq. I also provided bioinformatic analysis in clinical genetics and population genetics projects. Other interests: archeogenetics, linguistics and hiking.
