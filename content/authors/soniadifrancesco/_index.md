Welcome to my page! I have a background in Biomedical Engineering and hold a PhD in Epidemiology & Data Science from the Amsterdam University Medical Center. My research focuses on using digital health devices and developing machine learning models to analyze data from smartphones and wearables in clinical research. Currently, as a postdoc, I am developing and evaluating the effectiveness of a chatbot tailored for oncology patients, providing timely supportive care services and treatment recommendations.
