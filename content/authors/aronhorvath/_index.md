I am a biomedical engineer with a Ph.D. in biomechanics from ETH Zurich. My key focus is to leverage state-of-art sensing technologies in combination with machine learning to develop smart human-sensing solutions for monitoring&preventing diseases. In my free time, I enjoy playing the guitar, reading, and doing sport.
