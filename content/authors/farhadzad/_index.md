As a senior researcher at KrauthammerLab at the University of Zurich (UZH) and at the Institute of Applied Information Technology (IniT) at Zurich University of Applied Sciences (ZHAW), my research interests center around computational approaches to language understanding, adapting neural language models to low- and zero-resource scenarios, multimodal multilingual machine learning, and the application of NLP in Medicine.

I hold a Ph.D. in Language Technology with a computer science background and also have industry experience. I have worked on various natural language processing (NLP) projects before, during, and after the Ph.D. program since 2013, during my Ph.D. I worked on various adaptation techniques for low-resource NLP scenarios. My Ph.D. thesis is a monograph work and consists of a detailed explanation of the six papers published in top computational linguistic venues. During my post-doctoral time at the University of Zurich, I worked on Multimodal Multilingual NLP both in general and medical domains.

Over the last year, I have experience in teaching advanced seminar courses and mentoring students at all levels. Overall, my research focuses on adapting NLP methods with a focus on cross-lingual and cross-modality transfer.
