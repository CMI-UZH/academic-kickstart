I am interested in monitoring / preventing diseases through the use of smart sensors and machine learning. I studied at ETH Zurich and during my master I focused on developing algorithms for risk quantification for complex engineering problems. Other interests of mine include triathlon, hiking & climbing and playing piano and drum-set.
