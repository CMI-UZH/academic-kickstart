I am a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Zurich and the University Hospital of Zurich, with a strong passion for applying machine learning techniques to healthcare data in order to enhance patient outcomes. Outside of research, I enjoy staying active through various sports, including CrossFit, basketball, and swimming.
