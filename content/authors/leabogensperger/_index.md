I studied Biomedical Engineering at Graz University of Technology. Subsequently, I completed my PhD studies in Computer Science, where I focused on variational methods in medical imaging using machine learning. Lately, I worked on generative models, including diffusion models, for medical image segmentation. My research interests lie at the intersection of deep learning and machine learning with applications in the medical domain.
