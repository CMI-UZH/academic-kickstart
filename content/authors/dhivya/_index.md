I am passionate about all things data. I completed my PhD in Computer Science in Zurich, specializing in data science, with a focus on enhancing AI-assisted data science development through insights from software engineering and human-computer interaction (HCI).
In my professional career, I have worked as a software engineer and have several years of experience in full-stack software development and data science. I also have extensive expertise in developing, evaluating, and conducting empirical studies on software systems, particularly in the integration of AI within Human-AI collaboration systems. Additionally, I have teaching experience and have held a leadership role in Women in Data Science, Zurich.

In my free time, I enjoy practicing yoga and painting.
