I am a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Zurich and the University Hospital of Zurich. I work in natural language processing (NLP) for clinical applications to help medical research and improve healthcare delivery and outcomes.

I received my PhD from Queen Mary University of London, where I worked on language models for conversational AI and its applications in multimodal cognitive decline detection. I received my MSc from the University of Tehran in 2018.
