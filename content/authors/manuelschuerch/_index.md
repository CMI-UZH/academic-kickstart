I studied Computer Science and Statistics with focus on Machine Learning and Computational Statistics. Afterwards, I’ve completed my PhD in Artificial Intelligence in the area of probabilistic Machine Learning models. In particular, I’ve work with scalable Gaussian Processes. My current research focus is probabilistic Time Series modelling for medical data.
