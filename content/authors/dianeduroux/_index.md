After my master's studies in statistics and bioinformatics, I obtained my PhD at the University of Liège, with a primary focus on precision medicine, systems biology and machine learning. I then joined the ETH AI Center in Zurich, where my research revolves around the development of clinical decision support tools to optimize and recommend treatment strategies.
