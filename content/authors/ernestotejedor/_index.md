I am a Mathematics student specializing in Statistics. More concretely, I’m interested in the synergy that Causality and Machine Learning can create to help solve some of the most challenging problems in Data Science.

In my Master’s Thesis, I’m investigating how to accurately estimate the outcome of counterfactual organ transplants from observational genetic and phenotypic data. Outside of the office, I like to meet friends, play Hockey or enjoy nature running and swimming.
