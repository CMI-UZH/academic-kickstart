I studied Data Science with a focus on Data Modeling and Warehousing. I also hold an engineering degree in electronics. Afterwards, I specialized in Project & Program Management. I have extensive industry experience, having worked with some of the biggest multinational brands for the last 12 years, leading large-scale global programs. I hold various certifications in Scrum, Prince2, & Lean Six Sigma. Interesting fact, I started my career working on improving the security infrastructure for the Parliament house in India.
