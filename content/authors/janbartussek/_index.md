My research combines concepts and methods from biology, physics and mathematics to gain fundamental insights in biological processes. Since 2019, I am appointed as a research group leader at the Institute for Intensive Care in the University Hospital Zurich. I am focusing on the analysis of pathophysiological dynamics using high-resolution health data, collected by our patient data management system (PDMS). As a research associate of the Krauthammer lab, I am organizing our efforts to analyze PDMS data for outcome prediction with machine learning algorithms.
