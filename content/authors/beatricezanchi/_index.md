I am a Biomedical Engineer, and I obtained my M.Sc degree at Politecnico of Torino in 2021. During my master study, I focused on Machine Learning methods to diagnose Inherited Arrhythmogenic Diseases. Currently, I keep working on electrical heart disease recognition through Artificial Intelligence tools to support healthcare specialist. In my spare time, I enjoy reading and being outside running.
