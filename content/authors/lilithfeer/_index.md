I studied biomedicine with a strong focus on bioinformatics and finished my Master of Science at University of Zurich. My strong interest in bioinformatics led me to become a Bioinformatician at [ETH Zurich](https://ethz.ch/en.html), where I offered my bioinformatics expertise in the NCCR Microbiomes. I developed software, performed customized data analysis, developed pipelines and managed sequencing data. In November 2024, I started my PhD in the Krauthammer lab, where I specialize in protein design and machine learning techniques to integrate multiple data modalities.
In my free time, I enjoy running and being outdoors.
