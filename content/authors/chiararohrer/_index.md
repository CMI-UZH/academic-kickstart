I got my bachelor’s degree in Health Sciences and Technology from ETH Zürich, during which I spent a exchange semester in Norway. Now I am pursuing my master’s degree in Computational Biology and Bioinformatics and as part of my studies, I am spending a semster here in the lab, working on the implementation of an AI tumor board. In my free time, I enjoy doing sports, especially playing football, and being out in nature.
