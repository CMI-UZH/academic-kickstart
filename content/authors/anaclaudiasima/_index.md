My main research interest is in the impact of Semantic Web Technologies for the Life Sciences, particularly in Semantic Search over Knowledge Graphs. I enjoy working at the boundary between disciplines as part of collaborations with both academia and the industry. During my PhD I designed and implemented Bio-SODA, a Question Answering system over Bioinformatics Knowledge Graphs, as part of an SNF-funded NRP-75 “Big Data” project between the ZHAW, UNIL and SIB. More recently, I have started investigating the role of Large Language Models in democratizing data access to scientific Knowledge Graphs. 

I am currently co-leading the Knowledge Representation Unit at SIB, with the mission of improving scientific data exchange and reuse in Switzerland and worldwide, particularly in Bioinformatics. P.S.: I speak SPARQL  and I enjoy taking part in hackathons and hiking.
