I just finished my M.Sc. in Management, Technology and Economics from
ETH Zurich, writing my master thesis on "Managing Disease Diagnoses using
Structured and Unstructured Clinical Data". Previously, I worked at Roche
Sequencing Solutions in Santa Clara, USA, developing a next-generation nanopore
sequencing instrument. My research interests are in machine learning for health
care. Supporting health providers with various intelligent systems to improve
current systems and save lives is what motivates me to work everyday.
