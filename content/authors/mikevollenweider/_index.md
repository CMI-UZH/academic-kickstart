By helping to model reality and “dust off” available data, as professor Van de Geer termed it, I hope to help uncover some of nature’s hidden truths. To acquire the necessary skills for doing so, I studied Computational Science and Engineering for my Bachelor’s degree and am currently finishing my Master’s degree in Data Science. At the time, I am especially interested in use cases of causality and optimal transport theory in genomics. Besides doing science, I like to dance, practice yoga, and play the piano.
