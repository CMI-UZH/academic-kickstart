I am a PhD student specializing in the clinical application of machine learning in microbiology. My current research focuses on improving bacterial identification in matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry using machine learning. I began my academic journey in human movement sciences but discovered a passion for data science along the way. Before starting my PhD, I worked as a data scientist at the University Medical Centre Groningen (UMCG), contributing to various research projects.
