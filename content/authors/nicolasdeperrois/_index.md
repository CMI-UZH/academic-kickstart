I have an interdisciplinary education in both biological and quantitative sciences, with a Master’s degree in neuroscience from the Ecole normale supérieure (France) and a PhD in computational neuroscience from the University of Bern  (Switzerland)

At KrauthammerLab, I aim to develop multimodal models for the interpretation of radiology data, by working in close collaboration with Farhad Nooralahzdeh, computer scientists from ETH Zurich and radiologists from the University Hospital of Zurich.
