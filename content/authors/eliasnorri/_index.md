I obtained my bachelor's degree in life sciences engineering at EPFL (Lausanne), and currently, I am a master's student in health sciences and technology with a focus on bioinformatics and machine learning. In the lab, I am working on a prediction model for kidney transplantations, aiming to provide a usable decision-making tool.

Outside of my studies, I am interested in practicing sports such as football and tennis. I also enjoy painting and drawing.
