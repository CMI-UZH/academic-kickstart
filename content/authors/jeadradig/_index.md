After studies in mathematics and physics, I am specialising in medical technologies. I am particularly interested in tackling problems in the realm of genomics and biophysics leveraging computer science. I am currently working on cfDNA sequencing. We use deep learning techniques to enable diagnosis of cancer from the analysis of cfDNA. Outside of work, I am fond of sport. I love to run, bike and swim. If you think you could beat, do not hesitate to contact me!
