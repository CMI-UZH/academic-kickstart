I have a Computer Science and Bioinformatics background and completed my master thesis in the area of Cancer Genomics at the University of Bern. My ambition for developing clinically-useful knowledge led me to start my PhD in Biomedical Informatics. In my free time I am engaged in bouldering, jiu jitsu and deadlifts.
