Melissa is currently pursuing her Master's degree in Applied Computational Life Sciences. Her Master's Thesis project is on the deconvolution of nucleosome positioning signals from cell-free DNA sequencing data. In addition to her current studies, she enjoys studying complex and dynamic systems that are human fabricated and naturally occurring.
