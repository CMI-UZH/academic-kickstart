I completed my masters in Lausanne at EPFL in applied mathematics. During my master thesis, I worked on a dynamic clinical decision support system using machine learning to diagnose the cause of febrile illnesses in children. When away from the screen, I enjoy being outside running, hiking or playing tennis.
