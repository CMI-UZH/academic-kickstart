I am in my second year of the ETH Master "Computational Biology and Bioinformatics". Coming from a health science background I am very interested in combining the field of machine learning with patient data and 
health care. In my spare time, I love to do some cultural activities (going to concerts, etc.) or enjoy a beer with friends.
