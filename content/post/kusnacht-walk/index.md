To enjoy some of the last weekends with good weather this year, we decided to go for a nice walk along the Tobelweg in Küsnacht. We met at the railway station Küsnacht ZH (not to be confused with Küssnacht am Rigi, we were there last year https://krauthammerlab.ch/post/rigi-lab-hike/)

After everyone arrived, we started our little walk towards the forest. Following a short elevation, we turned toward the stream and for the rest of the way, we were walking upstream.

The nice little waterfalls of the stream complemented by autumn forest landscape provided a nice setting for our Saturday walk.

Walking and chatting, we quickly reached the nearby village Zumikon, where we took the regional train back to Zurich.

Once in Zurich, we put the icing on the cake by having icecreams and frappés and enjoying the sun by the lake.
