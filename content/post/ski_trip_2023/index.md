Towards the end of March, the Krauthammer Lab went on 2-day ski trip to Davos, with an overnight stay in Davos. 

An early start from Zürich on the first day meant that we could get a 7am train to the resort, check into our accomodation, and be on the slopes by 10am. There we found broad white slopes, with the blue sky providing a nice contrast. We did the first few ski runs as a full group, before splitting up into three groups - beginners, intermediates, and those with little regard for their safety (or, advanced). After a few hours we were all back together for lunch in a mountain restaurant, before going back out for a few more hours.

While the larger group were battling gravity on the slopes, two perhaps more sensible members of the lab, had a more relaxing day in the valley, having some nice food and enjoying the views and weather. We all met up then in the evening for some games and then a tasty dinner in the village.

The next day followed a similar track, but in reverse. We met up for breakfast, skied (or relaxed), had lunch, then checked out of the hostel and got trains back to Zürich. Some left shortly after lunch, others stayed and used one of the last possible ski days of the season to its fullest.
