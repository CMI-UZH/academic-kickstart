On Saturday 24th October, we put on our hiking shoes and headed off for an adventure.

Our meeting point was Rigi Kaltbad, a resort in the Swiss Alps overlooking beautiful Lake Lucerne. It is easily accessible by railway from Vitzanu, a cable car from Weggis or by foot from Küssnacht am Rigi.

A portion of our lab decided for the latter option and met a few hours earlier for a pre-hike. They met cows, enjoyed stunning views, and elevated heart rates which are all typical for a Swiss hike.

Our paths converged at the Rigi Kaltbad and we started the journey to Rigi Scheidegg. The clouds covered most of the Alps in the early afternoon, but as we were walking and talking, they agreed to reveal us hidden views.

Engaging conversations made us forget about hunger for some time. Not for a very long time, though! We spotted a good bench and Prof Krauthammer surprised us with a variety of tasty snacks, sandwiches, and fruits pulled out of the biggest of all bags. Fueled, we continued to Rigi Scheidegg.

The path we were walking on, once was a Rigi–Scheidegg railway. Nowadays, the rail line’s trackbed serves as a 6.7 kilometers long panoramic footpath ideal for lab outings during pandemic times.

At our final destination, we spent some time resting and enjoying warm drinks over the chatter. Then, we went down to Kräbel by a cable car and soaked in the last bits of panoramic views before returning to our cozy homes.
