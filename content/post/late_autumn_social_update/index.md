As always, the lab has been busy. Several lab members have left the lab, and we bid farewell to them. 
In August, we barbecued in the forest to celebrate the time that Cécile and Manuel spent with us in the lab. Cécile won a UZH Doc.Mobility grant and is visiting at Yale, whereas Manuel is continuing as a postdoc at Harvard.

For our BBQ, we went up to the tower at Loorenkopf and enjoyed some vegetables, sausages and halloumi accompanied by some drinks. And as dessert, we also had some smores.

October saw the second PhD defence of the lab. Ivna presented her work at Irchel and after some questions by the committee, she came out of the auditorium as Dr. Ivna. Congratulations!

We've not only had farewells but also some welcomes as quite a few new members joined the lab recently. We hope to sit together at the Christmas dinner soon. Stay tuned for pictures of that.
