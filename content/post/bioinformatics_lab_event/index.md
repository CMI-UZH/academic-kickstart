Last month, the Krauthammerlab and four other bio-informatics groups (Boeva, Menze, RÃ¤tsch and Vogt labs) from the ETH, UZH and USZ organized their first joint event. The goal of the evening was to meet and learn more about the research activities of the different groups.

Each of the PIs gave a talk, introducing their lab and giving some background on the projects they are working on.

Afterwards, all participants (PIs included!) were randomly divided into small groups to have the opportunity to meet and talk about their research interests in an informal way, over a drink and some snacks. It was a great opportunity to instigate new collaborations.

We look forward to the next event!
