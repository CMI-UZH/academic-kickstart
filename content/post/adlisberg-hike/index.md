The first Krauthammer Lab hike in Wittikon. Although it was raining, it was very nice to see some faces of the group and their companions. 

First we walked along the Elefantenbach to the first stop at Restaurant Degenried. Then, with a well-filled stomach, we walked up to the Loorenkopf tower, our second stop. There we climbed the 30 m high observation tower and could only see the fog because of the bad weather.

After that, we continued to the wooden fountain with carved owls, our last stop. Afterwards it started to rain and so we returned with warm tea on the way.
